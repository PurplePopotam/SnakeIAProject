# SnakeIAProject
A genetic-algorithm based artificial intelligence playing snake

The snake can see in 4 directions only.
I've achieved a score of 54 at best.

I think better scores can we reached if the snake is provided more directions to look. Another possible amelioration would be the structure of the neural network. 

I've been inspired by CodeBullet's first video and this one also https://youtu.be/zIkBYwdkuTk

To display the games I use OneLoneCoder's command prompt method (using <windows>) so you'll need to be on Windows to run it.
